# Davies Lab - Oceanographic Data Trial

## Instructions for processing and plotting ctd data task

The "Data" folder within this repository contains a file with the name "SBE19plus_01908365_2025_10_15.cnv" obtained from a Seabird CTD instrument.

This instrument measures variables such as salinity, temperature, fluorescence, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen at programmed intervals. Seabird stores this data in a text format with the extension "*.cnv", which is both human-readable and handled easily with the R package "oce".

This particular CTD was deployed on one of our benthic landers for a period of 14 months from August 2024 - October 2025. The CTD was programmed to take measurements every 2 hours while positioned near a deep-sea coral habitat at approx. 1050 meters deep. The time series we have collected will be used to understand oceanographic patterns that control important ecological processes like food supply and physical dynamics in seafloor habitats.

This trial exercise must be completed with good practice, and minimal assistance from Drs Davies and Carrick, the intent is to give you a taste of what our lab does and how we approach these challenges. We expect students to utilize the broad range of technologies encountered in the trial, and to trouble shoot issues independently.

### Here are the instructions that you received via email:

Step 1. If you have not already, create a github account: https://github.com/ and download the github desktop app.
Step 3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
Step 3. Familiarize yourself with the contents of the repo, including the “README.md” file that contains information about the data and directory structure and the coding instructions.
Step 4. Create a new R project using the existing repository directory.
Step 5. In a new R script within the project, write a code to import, re-format, visualize, and export the given data from the coding instructions provided. Ensure that all your code is well-commented.
Step 5. Once you have completed the code exercise, commit and push your changes to GitHub, this will provide options to generate a "fork" of the repository, please ensure the repository is set to "Private" and then invite both Dr Davies (marecotec) and Dr Carrick (jvcarrick) to the repository (found in the settings page for that repo). We will then review the repository.

Sharing of your repo is due: Dec 12, 2025 at 17:00 EST, this exercise should take no more than about 4 hours to complete.
